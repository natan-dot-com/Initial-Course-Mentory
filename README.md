# Initial-Course-Mentory
Initial Computer Science mentory made to help newcomers in programming world. Mainly focused in practical learning.
This repository intends to has a introductory C approach, together with useful tools I've learning during my undergraduate course.

## Motivation
As a friend of mine has started his university days recently, he tought it was a good idea to get help from people with a bit more of knowledge. Since I know how does it feel to get thrown out of the blue into the Computer Science world, I also tought I could help him showing some introductory concepts I've learned so far. Even though I'm not _that_ experienced, I think I can expose him to some useful technologies and tools I had been exposed before (like Linux or Git) and get to him a formed introduction in C programming.

Everything here is purely for education pourposes and does not substitute any university classes. My only intention is to help someone who's close to me.

It can be a bit challenging, but I've always heard that one of the best learning methods in any context is to teach it to someone. That's what I'm trying to do, for sure I'll be a gorgeous experience. :)
